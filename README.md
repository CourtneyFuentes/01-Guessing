# 01-Guessing
This is a guessing game written in Python. The purpose of creating this project was both to help me understand more about control structures and data types and to also fulfill requirements for my first project in my C220 class.

To play, the player follows the instructions given and guesses a number between 1 and 100. It will then either inform the player that they are too high, too low, or that they guessed the number correctly. The player will be allowed to guess until they correctly guess the right number and the player will be told how many guesses it took for them to get to that pont. After they guess the correct number the player will be asked if they wish to play again.
